# Status and discussions on Wednesday, 18/09/24:

## ToDos: 

1. Make data usable.
    1. Understand COCO format (enough to use it)
    2. Find a way for JSON handling, i.e. image ids in  annotations
    3. Find a way to define a dataset for (e.g.) PyTorch
        - i.e., combine image with annotations

2. Get some training running:
    1. Have a look at DSR content, example notebooks etc.
    2. Decide between tensorflow and pytorch
    3. Decide between old RCNN model and YOLO?
        - ToDo: Recover pretrained yolo models..?
        - Note: Possibly try one of those *without* training on our data? 
    4. Set up notebook for training with my cucumber data 
        - First step: Read in data, perhaps one photo with labels, make sure that works!

3. Everything else: later!
    1. actually do the training
    1. think about video data
    2. and streaming input


## Questions: 

1. Comments from Krzysztof on my previous status writeup?
2. Let's discuss the structure of the annotations vs. images
3. Bboxes vs. masks? 
4. Comments on ToDo list/next steps?
